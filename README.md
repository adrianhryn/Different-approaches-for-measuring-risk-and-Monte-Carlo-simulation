# Different-approaches-for-measuring-risk-and-Monte-Carlo-simulation
In this project, I was reviewing different approaches for measuring risk for stocks prices. The main company of this investigation was  Amazon and in the last update of the project I also added analusis for S&P500 index. In my work, I consider Bollinger bands, k-standard deviations approach; then I test if top companies daily movings in stock prices follow the Random Walk process, and in the last part, I did Monte Carlo simulations for predicting huge loses for stock. I took the financial data from Kaggle and Yahoo finance.
